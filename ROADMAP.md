# BrainRouter roadmap

This is the planning index for work that is not yet released. Shipped detail
lives in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and
[`brainrouter-changelog/`](brainrouter-changelog/); design decisions live in
[`brainrouter-docs/`](brainrouter-docs/).

## Release status

The latest tagged release is **0.4.16** (2026-07-01). Version **0.4.17** is the
active, unreleased development line. A capability present on a development
branch is not considered shipped until its release gate passes and a version is
tagged.

## What 0.4.16 established

BrainRouter is already a multi-surface agent operations product. Desktop is the
primary workbench, while Dashboard is the shared operations surface.

- **Desktop** is the primary Electron workbench for Chat, Code, and Track. It
  includes projects and sessions, Monaco editing and diffs, plans,
  requirements, tools, terminal, Atlas, workflows, automations, settings, and
  local review.
- **CLI** runs the same agent runtime, model routing, permission system,
  orchestration, workflows, and memory lifecycle in a terminal-native shell.
- **Dashboard** manages authenticated organizations, projects, providers,
  connections, repositories, knowledge, fleet work, and review operations.
- **Brain** serves PostgreSQL-backed MCP and REST contracts for memory,
  tenancy, connectors, jobs, and shared clients.
- **Track** provides board, list, backlog, sprint, roadmap, reports,
  automation, members, and repository synchronization inside the workbench.

The changelog remains the source of truth for the exact shipped inventory.

## 0.4.17 — Runtime body and product completion

**Status: implementation and release validation in progress.** The active line
adds an execution plane and makes the dashboard and desktop feel like one
coherent product. The release remains default-safe: hosted or container
execution, inbound triggers, and other expanded authority stay opt-in.

### Runtime and automation

- [x] Runtime port with process, worktree, opt-in container, and declared hosted
      backends; lifecycle controls, archives, and app-preview port registration.
- [x] Inbound automation foundation for signed GitHub, GitLab, Slack, and Jira
      events with repository allowlists and redelivery idempotency.
- [x] Requirement intake, suggested-task scanning, fleet jobs, and verified
      draft-PR delivery paths.
- [x] Critic gates, task budgets, named model profiles, and role-aware model
      routing.
- [x] Plugin packaging, validation, installation, consent, registry search, and
      desktop marketplace controls.
- [x] Desktop runtime monitor, automation controls, provider configuration, and
      write-only secret handling.

### Shared product surface

- [x] A durable interface contract for dashboard, desktop, and CLI naming,
      semantic color, navigation, forms, motion, and accessibility.
- [x] Focused Settings navigation: a category rail and subsection selector render
      one panel at a time instead of one long settings document.
- [x] Authenticated dashboard chat with organization, project, and workspace
      knowledge scope and attributable source links.
- [x] Server-backed source ownership and filtering across organization, project,
      workspace, and user boundaries.
- [x] Account-linked connector OAuth with sealed server-side credentials and a
      shared connection state for dashboard and desktop.
- [x] Desktop Track repository detection, account-backed synchronization,
      account-managed automations, and server-backed pull-request review history.
- [x] GitHub pull-request review operations with separate security and code
      lenses, repository policies, evidence, and live job status.
- [ ] Complete the repository-wide build, test, browser, and Electron acceptance
      gate; reconcile release notes; bump versions; tag and publish.

Implementation checkmarks in this section describe the active development line,
not a published release.

## 0.5.0 — Operational scale

Planned themes, subject to validation and reprioritization:

- [ ] Hosted-runtime deployment and operational controls for teams.
- [ ] Stronger fleet observability across queues, workers, costs, and artifacts.
- [ ] Per-agent recall diagnostics and evidence drill-down in the dashboard.
- [ ] Verified provider and connector compatibility matrix.
- [ ] Stable `@kinqs/brainrouter-sdk` 1.0 contract.
- [ ] Release-grade packaging and update coverage across supported desktop
      platforms.

## Designed, not scheduled

- Per-session isolation for multiple terminals on one repository —
  [`per-session-isolation.md`](brainrouter-docs/specs/per-session-isolation.md).
- Additional knowledge ingestion providers after the current OAuth and runtime
  connector matrix is verified.
- A published MCP server container image.
