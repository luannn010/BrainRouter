/**
 * BRAIN-P1-T3 (0.4.1) — synchronous job wrapper for the live pipeline.
 *
 * `runAsJob` wraps an existing pipeline-stage call so that every run
 * leaves a durable `memory_jobs` row: it enqueues the job, flips it to
 * `running`, executes the real work, and stamps `done` (with a compact
 * output summary) or `failed` (with the error). This is the
 * "observability-first" wiring the design permits — the proven inline
 * scheduling in `capture.ts` is untouched; we only make each stage
 * observable + auditable.
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - Jobs created here use `maxAttempts: 1`. There is no background
 *    runner loop yet (a later slice), so a failure is terminal `failed`
 *    rather than a misleading re-armed `pending` that nothing will pick
 *    up. When the async runner lands, queue-scheduled jobs will use the
 *    agent's real `maxAttempts`.
 *  - The original error is re-thrown so existing callers' `.catch`
 *    logging continues to behave exactly as before.
 *  - Enqueue + start happen synchronously before the first `await`, so
 *    the row is visible immediately — even for fire-and-forget callers.
