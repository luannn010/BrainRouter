# 09 — Docs, Skills, Agents & Plugins

Where documentation lives, how skills/ADRs/specs are authored, and the plugin +
marketplace conventions.

---

## Documentation topology

### 1. Know the three doc trees

- **`docs/`** = universal **TEMPLATES only** (contains a literal "TEMPLATE ONLY"
  marker; categories `api/design/schema/deployment/hooks/strategy` are served
  read-only via the MCP doc tools to *downstream* projects). Do **not** put
  BrainRouter's own living docs here — that leaks internal content to clients.
- **`brainrouter-docs/`** = living deep docs (memory-engine.md, cli.md, hooks.md,
  federation.md, configuration.md, policy.md, specs/, decisions/).
- **`brainrouter-changelog/<version>.md`** = per-release notes; root `CHANGELOG.md`
  is the current-release view (Keep-a-Changelog). See [`08`](08-git-release-and-changelog.md).
- **Evidence:** `docs/TEMPLATE ONLY`, `brainrouter-docs/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md:1`

### 2. `brainrouter-docs/README.md` is the mandatory index; top-level docs stay short

Top-level repo docs (README, BRAINROUTER, PRESENTATION) deliberately stay short;
deep dives live in `brainrouter-docs/`. **Every new deep doc, spec, or ADR must be
linked from `brainrouter-docs/README.md`** with a 1–3 line summary — the README is
the navigation surface, not an afterthought. Unindexed docs are effectively lost.

- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-docs/README.md:1,46`

### 3. `architecture-folder-structure-rules.md` is the boundary law — reference it, don't restate it

For structural questions, defer to
[`brainrouter-docs/architecture-folder-structure-rules.md`](../brainrouter-docs/architecture-folder-structure-rules.md).
Its layer model: **domain** (pure, no I/O) ← **contracts** (wire/store payloads,
type guards, stable IDs) ← **ports** (interfaces) ← **services** (use-cases
coordinating ports + domain) ← **presentation** (CLI/TUI/Desktop), with adapters
implementing ports and owning side effects; domain must be unit-testable without
mocks. Non-negotiables: memory stays central; all three apps follow the same
layered ownership; no new god files; no cosmetic folder moves; committed files
never name external reference projects nor copy their code; workflow state is
durable and linkable (requirements↔tasks↔artifacts↔reviews↔memory IDs);
branch/workspace state is read live from git, cached only with invalidation. New
convention docs link to it instead of duplicating it (this folder does exactly
that).

- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-docs/architecture-folder-structure-rules.md:7,77,216`

### 4. `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` are the living workflow artifacts at repo root

Track release work in a root `task.md`: a header block restating the binding rules
(target branch, one feature per PR, CI gates, no AI attribution), then checkbox
sections using the legend `[ ]` todo, `[x]` done, `[~]` in progress, `[U]` blocked
on user. On handover, write/update `walkthrough.md` with two sections: "## Completed
Changes" (behavior-level bullets, not raw diffs) and "## Verification" (the exact
commands run, one per line). Verify tests/lint green before writing the walkthrough.

- **Why:** these files are the contract between sessions/agents; `CLAUDE.md`'s
  workflow phases and the handover-skill assume this exact shape.
- **Evidence:** `task.md:1`, `walkthrough.md:1`, `CLAUDE.md`

### 5. Specs and ADRs live in `brainrouter-docs/` and are never deleted

- **Specs:** `brainrouter-docs/specs/<kebab-feature>.md`, titled `# Spec: …`,
  immediately followed by a `> Status:` blockquote tracking lifecycle
  ("in progress on `<branch>`" / "SHIPPED in 0.4.12" with links). Write + get
  approval on the spec **before** core code (SPECIFY→PLAN→TASKS→IMPLEMENT); retain
  it as the design of record after shipping.
- **ADRs:** `brainrouter-docs/decisions/ADR-NNN-<kebab-title>.md`, sequential
  three-digit numbering, header with a bold Status line + explicit `Supersedes:` /
  `Builds on:` links, a blockquote TL;DR, then Context / Decision / consequences.
  **Never delete** an ADR — write a new one that supersedes it. Match existing ADR
  style (the real files use a compact one-line header that differs slightly from
  the skill's fuller template).
- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-docs/specs/memory-accuracy.md`, `brainrouter-docs/decisions/ADR-007-postgres-memory-store.md:1`

## Skills & agent personas

### 6. CLAUDE.md is the scenario→skill routing hub; develop locally, never via MCP tools

Treat `CLAUDE.md` as the primary agent instruction hub: when a dev task matches a
scenario, read the mapped `SKILL.md` **directly from the filesystem** and follow
it. **Never invoke `mcp_brainrouter_*` tools while developing this repo** (you're
building BrainRouter, not a client of it). When you add a development-relevant
skill, register it in CLAUDE.md's Scenario Mapping with a relative link
`skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`.

- **Evidence:** `CLAUDE.md`

### 7. Skill layout: `skills/<category>/<kebab-name>/SKILL.md`, name matches directory

Every skill is a directory containing exactly one `SKILL.md` at
`skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. The frontmatter `name` must be a
kebab-case slug **identical to the directory name**; the category is the first path
segment under the skills root (agent, api, codebase, communication, design, devops,
lifecycle, memory, qa, ux). Discovery walks max 5 levels and skips
`node_modules`/`.git`.

- **Why:** both the MCP registry and the CLI catalog derive name/category from the
  path; a mismatched frontmatter name breaks listing and resolution.
- **Evidence:** `brainrouter/src/registry.ts:61`, `brainrouter-cli/src/prompt/skillCatalog.ts:160`

### 8. SKILL.md frontmatter must stay regex-parseable — no full YAML

All frontmatter (SKILL.md, agent files, plugin `.local.md`) is parsed by small
dependency-free **regex** parsers, NOT a YAML library. Restrict frontmatter to
simple `key: value` scalars, block scalars (`key: |` with 2-space indented lines),
and simple `- item` lists. Required keys: `name`, `description`. Optional: `hints`
(agent guidance), `memory_hints` (a **separate** key the brain's
`memory_register_skill_hints` tool reads — don't confuse the two),
`disallowed-tools`.

- **Why:** nested/advanced YAML silently fails to parse; the codebase deliberately
  avoids pulling a YAML engine.
- **Evidence:** `brainrouter/src/memory/skills/skill-hints-loader.ts:15`, `packages/core/src/plugin/localConfig.ts:11`

### 9. SKILL.md body sections are machine-addressable — use the canonical `##` headings

The MCP `get_skill`/`update_skill` tools extract sections by heading name:
`## Overview`, `## When to Use`, `## Workflow` (the DEFAULT section served to
agents), `## Usage`, `## Detailed Instructions`, `### Phase N` blocks,
`## Verification` (checklist), `## Red Flags`, `## Common Rationalizations`. Keep
these exact heading names; a skill without a `## Workflow` section serves nothing
useful by default. Skills may declare `disallowed-tools` to blacklist tools for the
turn they run; slash commands map to skills via `SLASH_TO_SKILL` in
`skillRunner.ts` — author heavy workflow content in the skill body (the single
source of truth), keep the CLI prompt thin.

- **Evidence:** `brainrouter/src/types.ts:20`, `brainrouter/src/loader.ts:187`, `brainrouter-cli/src/prompt/skillRunner.ts:29`

### 10. Skill names are globally unique; know the shadowing precedence

Resolution is first-match-wins across ordered roots: workspace `<ws>/skills/` →
local `<ws>/.brainrouter/skills/` → plugin roots
(`.brainrouter/plugins/<name>/skills/`) → bundled (installed MCP package + monorepo
root `skills/`). A same-named skill in a lower-precedence root is **shadowed**
(surfaced as `<scope>:<name>` with a collision flag, not silently dropped). Don't
create two skills with the same name expecting both to load. `create_skill`
scaffolds with scope `global` (this repo) vs `local` (downstream project) and
refuses name collisions.

- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-cli/src/prompt/skillCatalog.ts:31,96,146`

### 11. Agent personas are single-role markdown; personas never call personas

Agent personas live as flat files at `agents/<kebab-name>.md` with `name` +
`description` frontmatter and a body written as a system prompt for **one** role
with one perspective and a defined output format. Respect the three-layer
composition: **Skill** = the *how* (workflow steps), **Persona** = the *who*
(viewpoint + report), **Command** = the *when* (user-facing entry composing the
other two). The user or a slash command orchestrates — **personas must not invoke
other personas**; skills are the only mandatory hops inside a persona's workflow.

- **Evidence:** `agents/README.md`, `agents/code-reviewer.md:1`

## Plugins & marketplace

### 12. Plugin manifest is `.brainrouter-plugin/plugin.json` — never `.claude`

A BrainRouter plugin is a folder whose manifest lives at
`.brainrouter-plugin/plugin.json` (the code repeatedly stresses: **never `.claude`
naming**). The only required field is `name` (kebab-case, validated by
`KEBAB_CASE_RE`); bad version/category produce **warnings, not hard failures**.
Component dirs are auto-discovered by convention when `contributes` omits them:
`skills/`, `agents/` (.md), `commands/` (.md), `hooks/hooks.json`, `workflows/`,
`connectors/`, `mcp.json` — so a skills-only plugin is just `plugin.json` +
`skills/`. Any explicit `contributes` path must be relative and stay inside the
plugin root (absolute and `..`-escaping paths are rejected at parse **and**
discovery time).

> Not to be confused with the repo's OWN `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the root,
> which distributes *this repo* as a Claude Code plugin — a different artifact.

- **Why:** the installer is deliberately warn-not-fail for soft fields; the path
  guards are a security boundary.
- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/manifest.ts:18-20,137`, `packages/core/src/plugin/discovery.ts:85`

### 13. Use `${BRAINROUTER_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for portable paths in plugin assets

Hooks, `mcp.json`, and connector assets inside a plugin must reference their own
files via the `${BRAINROUTER_PLUGIN_ROOT}` token (bare `$BRAINROUTER_PLUGIN_ROOT`
also expands), which the loader replaces with the plugin's absolute install root.
**Never hardcode absolute paths in plugin assets** (they break on install into a
different root per scope/machine).

- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/manifest.ts:21,228`

### 14. Plugin storage scopes and sidecar files

Plugins install to exactly two scopes: user `~/.brainrouter/plugins/<name>/`
(override home with `BRAINROUTER_HOME`) and workspace
`<ws>/.brainrouter/plugins/<name>/` (committable, project-pinned). Install
provenance is `install.json` in the plugin root; installs stage atomically via
`~/.brainrouter/plugins/.staging`. Per-project plugin config is
`<ws>/.brainrouter/plugins/<name>.local.md` — YAML frontmatter (machine config) +
Markdown body (human notes), inert unless a component reads it. Marketplaces are
indexed by a `brainrouter-marketplace.json` at the source root and recorded in
`cli.plugins.marketplaces[]` in `config.json`.

- **Why:** everything plugin-related keys off `.brainrouter/` conventions +
  `config.json` knobs; inventing new locations/env vars breaks loader resolution
  and the CLI-knobs-in-config rule.
- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/paths.ts:1`, `packages/core/src/plugin/marketplace.ts:1`

### 15. Plugins are packaging, not a runtime; loading is additive and never fatal

A plugin contributes paths that feed the **existing** subsystems (the same skill
catalog, agents, hooks, MCP, connectors, workflows) — **never build a parallel
plugin runtime**. Plugin loading in consumers must be best-effort (wrap in
try/catch so config or filesystem trouble never breaks the host feature — skill
discovery explicitly swallows plugin-loading errors). Plugin skill roots slot
between workspace roots (which still win) and bundled roots. `safeMode` disables all
skills and plugin loading entirely.

- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/discovery.ts:1`, `brainrouter-cli/src/prompt/skillCatalog.ts:104`

### 16. ⛔ Executable plugin capabilities are consent-gated through the existing exec policy

Command-type hooks and MCP command-servers shipped by a plugin stay **disabled**
until the user approves them via `cli.plugins.approved[name].{shell,mcp}`; enabling
a plugin first produces a disclosure summary ("3 skills, 2 hooks running `<cmd>`, …")
with a `requiresConsent` flag. Managed gating uses `allowedMarketplaces`/
`blockedMarketplaces`/`allowManagedHooksOnly` knobs. Compatibility mismatches
(`compatibility.brainrouterVersion`/`agentApiVersion`) warn but never hard-fail.
Keep the trust functions **pure** (no side effects) so they stay trivially testable.

- **Why:** plugins can ship arbitrary shell commands; the consent layer decides
  whether a contribution is even registered, while the normal two-axis exec policy
  gates the runtime call.
- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/trust.ts:1`, `packages/core/src/plugin/trust.test.ts`

### 17. Tag plugin/feature modules with their phase and colocate node tests

Every module in `packages/core/src/plugin/` opens with a doc comment tagged
`PLUGIN-MARKETPLACE P<n>` naming the phase, and cross-cutting call sites reuse the
same tag. Behavior ships with colocated `*.test.ts` in the same folder
(`plugin.test.ts`, `marketplace.test.ts`, `trust.test.ts`). Follow the same
feature-code tagging (`CC-SKILLS-D2`, `CC-CONFIG-A1`) when extending tagged
features elsewhere — the tags make a feature's slices greppable across packages.

- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/plugin/manifest.ts:2`, `packages/core/src/plugin/plugin.test.ts`
