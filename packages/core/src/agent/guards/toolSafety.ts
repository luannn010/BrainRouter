// 0.3.8-R4 — Single source of truth for which tool calls are safe to
// dispatch concurrently within one LLM response.
//
// Pre-R4 the runtime executed every tool call from one assistant message
// strictly serially. That's safe but it's pure latency loss for the common
// case of "read 5 files in one turn" — none of those reads share state or
// depend on each other's results. Writes and shell commands still need to
// serialize to preserve causality.
//
// `isParallelSafe(toolName)` is the conservative whitelist. Anything not on
// the list is treated as serial — the failure mode is "we ran something
// sequentially that could have been concurrent," which is the same
// performance the pre-R4 code shipped with. Adding tools here is the only
// way to opt them in.

/**
 * Local read-only tools whose execution is independent and has no
 * observable side effect on the workspace, on child-session state, or on
 * the agent's own bookkeeping. These can run concurrently within a single
 * LLM response.
 *
 * Explicitly EXCLUDED (must stay serial):
 *   - write_file / edit_file / apply_patch / run_command  — workspace mutation.
 *   - spawn_agent / spawn_agents — bookkeeping-sensitive (kept serial out of
 *     caution; the model usually drives spawns through task_agent /
 *     delegate_agent anyway).
 *   - wait_agent / wait_agents / close_agent / read_agent_transcript /
 *     route_task  — child-drain guardrail tracks observations one-by-one.
 *   - update_plan / goal_complete / goal_blocked  — session state mutation.
 *   - ask_user_choice  — interactive picker; must not interleave with other UI.
 *   - list_agents  — reads orchestration state but cheap and rarely batched.
 *
 * Concurrency-safe additions (0.3.9 — parallel agent spawn):
 *   - task_agent / delegate_agent run multiple children concurrently when
 *     batched in one assistant message. Safe because: (a) createSession +
 *     updateSession in orchestrator.ts are fully synchronous JS sequences
 *     (read → mutate → atomic rename) that cannot interleave under Node's
 *     single-threaded event loop, and (b) trackChildObservation is sync Set
 *     mutation. This matches Claude Code's "launch many agents in one
 *     message" UX — previously batched task_agent calls serialized end-to-end
 *     waits, which defeated the point of batching.
