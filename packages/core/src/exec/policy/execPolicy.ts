/**
 * CLI-11 (0.4.3) — unified execution-policy decision.
 *
 * One pure place that maps (action kind, access mode) → allow / ask / deny
 * (+ reason), so shell, file edits, child writes, network, and `/bg` stop
 * deriving their own answer from scattered access-mode checks. This encodes
 * the SAME tiers the agent's allowed-tool set uses today (read → read-only;
 * write → + file edits; shell → + run_command):
 *
 *   read:  read-only allowed; everything mutating denied
 *   write: + file edits / child writes; shell still denied
 *   shell: everything allowed
 *
 * This is the decision core (tested in isolation). Routing every I/O path
 * through it — replacing the scattered checks in agent.ts — is the follow-up.
