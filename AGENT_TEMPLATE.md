## Project context

{{PROJECT_PURPOSE}}

Before making changes, read the nearest repository instructions that apply to
the files in scope. Check for `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`.cursorrules`, and `codex.md` from the repository root down to the target
directory. A more specific instruction file takes precedence for files beneath
it.

Do not scan the whole repository when the task names a package, route, or file.
Start with the exact paths and use the documentation map below to expand only as
needed.

## Documentation map

| Need                                  | Source of truth                              |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Product and architecture              | [`{{DOCS_PATH}}`]({{DOCS_PATH}})             |
| API routes, schemas, and status codes | [`{{API_DOC_PATH}}`]({{API_DOC_PATH}})       |
| Interface tokens and component rules  | [`{{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}}`]({{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}}) |
| Repository-specific review policy     | `REVIEW.md`, when present                    |

## Build, test, and run

```bash
{{INSTALL_COMMAND}}
{{DEV_COMMAND}}
{{BUILD_COMMAND}}
{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}
{{TEST_COMMAND}}
{{LINT_COMMAND}}
```

Run the narrowest relevant test while iterating. Before reporting completion,
run the package or repository gate appropriate to the risk of the change.

## Working rules

- Read a file before editing it and preserve unrelated user changes in a dirty
  worktree.
- Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the requested behavior.
- Validate external input, API responses, file paths, and trust-boundary data;
  do not add speculative checks to impossible internal states.
- Prefer existing public modules and patterns over new abstractions.
- Keep generated files and committed build artifacts in sync when the repository
  explicitly tracks them.
- Never commit, push, publish, deploy, or modify external systems unless the user
  authorizes that action.
- Never expose secrets in output, logs, diffs, screenshots, or test fixtures.
- Use clickable `file:line` evidence when explaining code behavior.

## Change workflow

1. Restate the observable outcome and acceptance criteria.
2. Inspect the current implementation, tests, and applicable instructions.
3. Add or update a failing test when behavior changes.
4. Implement one coherent vertical slice.
5. Run targeted tests, then the broader required gate.
6. Inspect the final diff for unrelated edits, secret material, and generated
   artifact drift.
7. Report the outcome, validation commands, and any remaining limitation.

For a diagnosis-only request, stop after identifying and evidencing the cause.
Do not silently turn diagnosis into implementation.

## Architecture boundaries

Document this project's non-negotiable boundaries here before using the
template. At minimum, identify:

- which package owns business logic;
- which clients may call it and through which public API;
- which process owns filesystem, network, or credential access;
- how tenant, project, workspace, or account scope is enforced;
- which data is durable and which state is only a client cache.

Project-specific boundaries:

- {{PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARY_1}}
- {{PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARY_2}}
- {{PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARY_3}}

## Security and data handling

- Treat credentials as write-only. Store them only through the project's
  designated secret path and never return a stored secret to a client.
- Authorize on the server for every organization, project, repository, or user
  scope; a hidden client control is not authorization.
- Authenticate inbound webhooks with the provider's signature contract and keep
  signing secrets separate from account API credentials.
- Apply least privilege to tools, subprocesses, network access, and repository
  writes.
- Redact secrets and personal data before persistence, telemetry, or model input
  whenever the product contract requires it.

## UI work

- Follow [`{{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}}`]({{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}}) for tokens, layout,
  navigation, copy, motion, responsive behavior, and accessibility.
- Preserve keyboard operation, visible focus, reduced-motion behavior, and
  readable contrast.
- Implement loading, empty, error, disabled, and success states for changed
  interactions.
- Verify the actual application in a browser or native shell; a typecheck alone
  does not prove layout or interaction behavior.

## API and persistence work

- Treat [`{{API_DOC_PATH}}`]({{API_DOC_PATH}}) as the route contract.
- Keep request validation, authentication, authorization, and data filtering on
  the server boundary.
- Make migrations forward-safe and test both new and existing data paths.
- Do not expose internal exception text or provider credentials in API errors.
- Update shared types and client SDK contracts when a public response changes.

## Review policy

When `REVIEW.md` exists, it controls local repository review severity, skip
rules, nit limits, and project-specific checks. It does not grant write access or
weaken sandbox, network, secret, or approval policy.

Keep local workspace review separate from any server-side pull-request review
service. The local file only applies where the review runner explicitly loads
it.

## BrainRouter-aware hosts

When the host exposes BrainRouter tools, use them as a scoped continuity layer;
do not invent calls when the tools are unavailable.

1. Resolve or reuse the task session with `memory_resolve_session`.
2. Recall only context relevant to the active project or workspace with
   `memory_recall`; use `memory_search` for a focused follow-up.
3. Load a named workflow with `get_skill` when it clearly matches the task.
4. Offload large logs or file excerpts with `memory_working_offload` when that
   improves context quality.
5. Mark only records actually used with `memory_mark_cited`.
6. Capture the final outcome with `memory_capture_turn` when passive capture is
   not active.

Memory is supporting evidence, not a substitute for reading current code. Verify
drift-prone facts against the live repository before changing behavior.

## Handoff

A completion report must include:

- the user-visible outcome;
- important files changed;
- exact validation commands and results;
- known limitations or follow-up work;
- confirmation that no commit or external mutation was made, unless one was
  explicitly requested and completed.
