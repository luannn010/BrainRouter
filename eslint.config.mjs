// Flat ESLint config — first pass. The point of this config is ARCHITECTURE
// ENFORCEMENT, not a style/rule flood: it bans deep compiled-internal imports
// across package boundaries (the 442 `@kinqs/*/dist/*` imports the Refactor plan
// targets) as WARN, so the debt is surfaced without a flag-day. Promote to ERROR
// once Refactor P1 migrates them to curated package entrypoints, and add the
// back-edge bans then. Formatting is owned by Prettier (eslint-config-prettier
// turns off any conflicting rules).
