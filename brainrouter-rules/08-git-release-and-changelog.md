# 08 — Git, Release & Changelog

Commit conventions, branch model, lockstep versioning, the two-tier changelog, and
the manual publish flow.

---

## Commits & PRs

### 1. Commit subjects: conventional `type(scope)` + squash PR suffix

Write subjects as `type(scope): description` — type ∈
feat/fix/refactor/docs/chore, scope = the workspace or domain (core, cli, desktop,
brainrouter, types, apps, agent, track, connectors, dashboard, plugin, config,
release). PRs are **squash-merged**, so your subject becomes `… (#NNN)` on the
target branch. Subjects are long, descriptive fragments stating the user-visible
outcome, often with em-dash detail
(`feat(plugin): plugin + marketplace system (P1–P5) — manifest, loader, registry, desktop UI, publish (#797)`).
Verify style with `git log --oneline -80`.

- **Why:** the changelog is assembled from these subjects; scopes map 1:1 to
  workspaces so history is greppable per package.
- **Evidence:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, recent `git log`

### 2. ⛔ No AI co-author trailers in commits or PR bodies

**This overrides the harness default.** Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` or any
AI-attribution trailer to commits or PR bodies. Squash-merge bodies instead carry
per-slice commit subjects as `*` bullets plus a verification line.

- **Why:** the maintainer scrubbed all Claude co-author trailers from full history
  on 2026-06-02 and force-pushed. A handful of stray trailers from external cloud
  sessions exist in history — treat them as mistakes, not precedent.
- **Evidence:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

### 3. PR bodies follow the template; refactor PRs state verification counts

Use the template sections (Summary / Why / Changes / Test plan checkboxes / Docs &
changelog checkboxes / Breaking changes defaulting to "none"). New env vars must be
documented in `brainrouter/.env.example` or `brainrouter-cli/.env.example`.
Behavior-preserving refactor PRs end the body with an explicit verification line
(e.g. "Behavior-preserving split; public surface unchanged. Verified: 732 cli tests
pass."). Multi-slice PRs keep one `* type(scope): …` bullet per slice so the squash
body reads as a mini-changelog.

- **Why:** the squash body is the permanent history entry; the verification line is
  how reviewers distinguish mechanical refactors from behavior changes.
- **Evidence:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

## Branches & versioning

### 4. Release trains on `release/x.y.z`; tag `vX.Y.Z` on the merge to main

Each version is developed on a `release/x.y.z` branch (current:
`release/0.4.17`). Feature PRs target the release branch and are squash-merged. To
ship: merge `origin/main` into the release branch, land the bump + changelog
commits, open a PR from the release branch into `main`, and tag the merge commit
`vX.Y.Z`. Release-bump work can go through a `chore/release-x.y.z` side branch.
Desktop signed builds use a separate `desktop-v*` tag namespace.

- **Why:** `main` and `release/*` are branch-protected (PR + green "Build & Test
  (Node 22.x)" required); the `vX.Y.Z` tag on the main-merge commit marks a
  published version.
- **Evidence:** `.githooks/README.md:17`, `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml:16`

### 5. ⛔ Lockstep versioning across all workspaces

Every publishable package (`@kinqs/brainrouter-types`, `-agent-protocol`, `-core`,
`-sdk`, `-hooks`, `-mcp-server`, `-cli`) and every private app (dashboard, desktop,
monorepo root) carries the **same** version, and inter-package deps pin
`^<that version>` (not `workspace:`). Only private `brainrouter-benchmark` differs.
**Never bump one package independently.**

- **Why:** publishing in dependency order relies on each package's deps referencing
  the real semver of what published before it, so a fresh install resolves cleanly.
- **Evidence:** `package.json:4`, `brainrouter-cli/package.json:3`

### 6. Release close = two stereotyped commits touching every manifest

Ending a cycle needs (1) `chore(release): bump all packages + manifests to X.Y.Z`
— updates version AND inter-package `^X.Y.Z` pins in every workspace
`package.json`, the root `package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
`brainrouter/server.json` (version appears **twice**), and
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; and (2) `docs(release): X.Y.Z changelog + roadmap
status`. Missing `server.json` or `plugin.json` is a known slip — double-check them.

- **Evidence:** `package.json:4`, `brainrouter/server.json:5`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json:4`

### 7. `VERSION` reads from `package.json` at runtime — never hardcode

Each runtime package has a `version.ts` reading its own `package.json` at load and
exporting `VERSION`; every surface (CLI banner, MCP serverInfo/clientInfo,
User-Agent) imports that constant. A golden test asserts `VERSION ===
package.json` version. (SETUP.md §5.2's "5 hardcoded source-code references" list is
**stale** — version centralization made the bump `package.json`-only; the actual
0.4.16 bump touched 13 manifest files and zero `.ts` files.)

- **Evidence:** `packages/core/src/version.ts`, `packages/core/src/tests/version.test.ts`

---

## Changelog & roadmap

### 8. Changelog source of truth is `brainrouter-changelog/<version>.md`

User-visible changes go in the in-flight version file under `brainrouter-changelog/`
(start from `CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md`: intro paragraph, then Breaking/Removed, Added,
Changed, Fixed, Tests/Verification, Notes; 40–100 lines, user-facing language
first). Root `CHANGELOG.md` stays a concise "Current Release View" table + short
summaries — never a duplicate of the full file. When a version ships, replace
`Unreleased` with the date in both places and add a row to
`brainrouter-changelog/README.md`'s index table.

- **Why:** the two-tier changelog keeps the root file scannable while per-version
  files ship inside the CLI package for `/release-notes`.
- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-changelog/README.md:44-55`, `brainrouter-changelog/CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md`

### 9. `brainrouter-cli/changelog/` is generated at publish — never edit or commit it

It's gitignored and synthesized by the CLI's `prepublishOnly` → `sync-changelog`
script, which wipes it and copies every `.md` from repo-root
`brainrouter-changelog/`. `/release-notes` reads this bundled copy. **Edit only
`brainrouter-changelog/`.**

- **Evidence:** `.gitignore:32-35`, `brainrouter-cli/package.json:27-28`

### 10. Roadmap and changelog are strictly separated

Planned/future work goes in root `ROADMAP.md` (executive view) and
`brainrouter-roadmap/<version>.md` (per-release plans) — **never** in changelog
files. When a PR completes or re-scopes a planned item, update the matching roadmap
file. Explicitly rejected ideas live in
`brainrouter-roadmap/intentionally-excluded.md`.

- **Why:** changelogs record only what shipped; mixing plans in breaks the
  `/release-notes` bundle and the Keep-a-Changelog contract.
- **Evidence:** `brainrouter-changelog/README.md:52-53`, `brainrouter-roadmap/README.md`

## Publish & tooling

### 11. npm publish is manual, in dependency order, with absolute paths

Publish order is fixed: `packages/types` → `packages/sdk` → `packages/hooks` →
`brainrouter` → `brainrouter-cli`, using **absolute** `cd` paths (on macOS's
case-insensitive FS, relative `cd ../brainrouter` can land on the private monorepo
root `BrainRouter/` and fail with `EPRIVATE`) and no inline `#` comments (zsh
treats them as args). Auth is a granular `@kinqs/*` npm token with Bypass-2FA in
`~/.npmrc`. Before publishing: `npm run verify` green, then `npm pack --dry-run`
per package to check name/version, no `*.test.*` files, no `.env`/credentials, sane
sizes.

- **Why:** each package's deps pin the real semver of the ones published before it,
  so out-of-order publishes leave the registry unresolvable.
- **Evidence:** `SETUP.md:440-450,398-400`

### 12. Pack hooks bundle monorepo content and must leave the tree clean

The MCP server's `prepack` copies repo-root `skills/`, `agents/`, `references/`,
`docs/` into the package (recording them in `.bundled-content.json`) and `postpack`
removes exactly what was copied (skipping dirs that already existed). The CLI's
`prepack` builds then strips `*.test.*` from `dist/`; its `files` array whitelists
`changelog`. To change what ships, edit these scripts and the `files` arrays —
**never commit copies of root content into a package.**

- **Evidence:** `brainrouter/scripts/prepack.mjs`, `brainrouter/scripts/postpack.mjs`

### 13. `install-git-hooks.mjs` must stay fully defensive

Run from `prepare` on every `npm install`, it must never fail: it no-ops outside
this repo's own work tree, no-ops if the user set a custom `core.hooksPath`, and
swallows every error (exit 0). Preserve these guards — a thrown error there breaks
every install (including `npm ci` in CI and tarball installs).

- **Evidence:** `scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs:20-42`

### 14. Root `.pkg.json` and `.ci.yml` are gitignored stale scratch copies

`.pkg.json` (a 0.4.14-era copy of `brainrouter/package.json`) and `.ci.yml` (a
pre-Postgres copy of the CI workflow) are gitignored and have no git history. The
real files are `brainrouter/package.json` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. **Never
edit the root copies expecting effect, and never commit them.**

- **Evidence:** `.gitignore:121-122`

### 15. Desktop releases are a separate tag-triggered signed-build pipeline

Signed/notarized macOS builds run via `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`,
triggered manually or by pushing a `desktop-v*` tag (not `vX.Y.Z`).
`electron-builder` + `@electron/notarize` install with `npm install --no-save` so
the committed lockfile stays the deterministic source of truth; without Apple
secrets the pipeline fails open to an unsigned build so it stays verifiable.

- **Evidence:** `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml:16-17,42-45`
