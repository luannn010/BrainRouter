/**
 * Request-timeout policy for the memory pipeline's outbound calls (reranker,
 * embedding, generative extraction).
 *
 * CONTRACT (0.4.15+): by default these calls have NO client-side timeout. Recall
 * and extraction WAIT for the server however long it takes; only a *genuine*
 * failure — connection refused/reset, an HTTP error status, or a malformed body —
 * ends the call. Slowness alone must never abort. A CPU cross-encoder or a local
 * LLM under heavy multi-agent load can legitimately take minutes, and aborting it
 * mid-flight silently degrades recall to RRF (or drops a cognitive/graph extraction)
 * even though the server would have answered.
 *
 * A timeout is OPT-IN. Set the service's `*_TIMEOUT_MS` env to a positive integer to
 * re-impose a bound (e.g. against a flaky cloud endpoint, or as a safety net against
 * a server that accepts the socket but never replies — see the trade-off below).
 * `0`, empty, negative, and junk all mean "no timeout".
 *
 * TRADE-OFF the operator accepts by leaving timeouts off: a server that holds the
 * socket open but never responds will hold the call — and the concurrency slot it
 * occupies — until the socket itself drops. With no timeout there is nothing to
 * count as a failure, so neither a retry nor a circuit breaker can intervene; under
 * a cap-N pool, N such hangs wedge the pool. If that risk matters in a given
 * deployment, set the relevant `*_TIMEOUT_MS` to a generous bound as a backstop.
 */

 * Normalize a `*_TIMEOUT_MS` env value to milliseconds.
